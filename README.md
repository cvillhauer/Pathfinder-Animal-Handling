# Pathfinder-Animal-Handling
You may have heard of the Pathfinder gaming system, if you truly are a super nerd.

In the game, a player plays their character, but the character can also have one or more animal companions, be they a well-trained warhorse with a lifetime bond, or a wild bear that was tamed in passing.

Each animal type has its own stat block, so eventually this app could be used to manage a menagerie of animal companions, all cute and fuzzy and battle-ready.
